Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is:Round Robin


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)

scheduling_algorithm 1

Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
A: 319*4 + 1
B: 319*4 + 2
C: 319*4 + 3
D: 319*4 + 4
average: 319*4 + 10/4 = 1276+2.5 = 1278.5 milliseconds

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 800 milliseconds

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1.5 milliseconds
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1: (0+320+320*2+320*3)/4 = 320 * 6 / 4 = 480 milliseconds 



Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?
4A

scheduling_algorithm 2

I set initial priority as 10.
Then I set process2,3,4 the same priority 5 and process 1 with priority 1.
it will run process1 first then 2,3,4 will run alternatively.

Exercise 5:
During the execution of process 4.
Because during the printing of process 4, a clock interrupts process 4 then call scheduler  therefore 4 is not printed on the screen.
 

(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)
I declare a global variable lock
then used atomic_swap to implement this.
